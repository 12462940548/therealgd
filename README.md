raddit
======

raddit is a reddit clone made with [Symfony](https://symfony.com/).

This might end up being the backend for <http://raddit.me>. If not, the project
will be renamed and most likely abandoned.

## Status

This is an unfinished pre-release version. Functionality is missing and 
backwards compatibility will break.

## Contributions

Before contributing new features, please open an issue so we can discuss the
direction in which to take the project and avoid hurt feelings. Bug fixes are 
always welcome, however.

## License

The software is released under the zlib license. See the `LICENSE` file for 
details.
